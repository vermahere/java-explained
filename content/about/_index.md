## Hi, I’m Amit Verma 👋

I’m a Java developer who enjoys breaking down complex Java concepts into
clear, practical explanations.

**Java Explained** was created to help developers understand:
- Java internals
- Spring & JVM behavior
- Performance and best practices

Everything here is written from real-world experience, not theory.

If you enjoy the content, feel free to connect with me on GitHub or LinkedIn.
