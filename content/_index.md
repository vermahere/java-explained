## What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** widely used to build backend systems, web applications, android apps, enterprise software and large-scale distributed systems.

It is known for its **"write once, run anywhere"** capability, which makes it **Platform Independent**. This means, a code written in Java can be run on any device with a **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. This is why Java continues to power banks, payment systems, large enterprises, and cloud platforms.

## Why learn Java?

- Used to build **backend systems, web/cloud apps, android apps, enterprise software**
- Remains in high demand across multiple areas of software development, including **web, mobile, cloud, big data and AI**
- Supports **object-oriented programming**, enabling structured, reusable, and maintainable code
- Used by major tech players **(Amazon, Netflix, LinkedIn)**
- Supported by **massive community** across the globe who provides endless support and resources

## How Java Code Is Executed (High-Level)

Java follows a **compile + run** model:

1. You write Java source code (`.java`)
2. The Java compiler converts it into **bytecode** (`.class`)
3. Bytecode runs on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**
4. The JVM handles:
   - Memory management
   - Garbage collection
   - Thread scheduling
   - Platform abstraction

This architecture allows Java programs to run consistently across different operating systems.

## What This Site Focuses On

Java Explained is not a “learn Java in 30 days” site.

Instead, it focuses on:

- **Core Java concepts explained clearly**
- **Concurrency and memory model**
- **JVM behavior and performance**
- **Collections and internals**
- **Modern Java features**
- **Spring and backend fundamentals**

Articles are written to explain *why things work the way they do*, not just *how*.
