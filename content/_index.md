### What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** widely used to build backend systems, web applications, android apps, enterprise software and large-scale distributed systems.

It is known for its **"write once, run anywhere"** capability, which makes it **Platform Independent**. This means, a code written in Java can be run on any device with a **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. This is why Java continues to power banks, payment systems, large enterprises, and cloud platforms.

### Why learn Java?

- Used to build **backend systems, web and cloud applications, android apps, and enterprise software**
- Remains in high demand across multiple areas of software development, including **web, mobile, cloud, big data, and AI**
- Supports **object-oriented programming**, enabling structured, reusable, and maintainable code
- Has a rich ecosystem, including frameworks like **Spring** and **Hibernate**, well suited for enterprise development
- Used by major technology companies such as **Amazon, Netflix, and LinkedIn**
- Supported by a **large global community** that provides extensive documentation, tools, and learning resources

### How Java code Is executed

Let’s walk through the execution process:

1. You write Java source code (`.java`)
2. The compiler converts it into bytecode (`.class`)
3. The JVM loads and executes the bytecode

### Example:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java");
    }
}
```
